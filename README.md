# Example using dxf-viewer package with React

This is another example of [dxf-viewer](https://github.com/vagran/dxf-viewer) package application. It is written using React with the Material UI packages and react-splitter-pane.

It's not as nice as the "official" sample (here: [dxf-viewer-example-src](https://github.com/vagran/dxf-viewer-example-src)) - but that sample is written in Vue so this example should help get React developers started.

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jdh-invicara/dxf-viewer-react
cd dxf-viewer-react
npm install
npm run start
```

## Todo

* Add blocks details to info pane
* Display one instance of each block in the main pane (synthesize a temporary document for this)
